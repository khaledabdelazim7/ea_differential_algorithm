DE vs BP MNIST Comparison
This project presents a comparative study between Differential Evolution (DE) and Backpropagation (BP) for training the final classification head of a neural network on the MNIST dataset. The system is equipped with a Tkinter GUI to visualize and experiment with various DE strategies and compare their performance with standard backpropagation.

üß† Overview
The model architecture is a simple feedforward neural network:

Input (784) ‚Üí Dense(32, ReLU) ‚Üí Dense(16, ReLU) ‚Üí Dense(10, Softmax)

The feature extractor layers are pretrained and frozen.

Only the final classification head is trained using:

Differential Evolution (DE) with various strategies.

Standard Backpropagation (BP) for comparison.

üöÄ Features
Supports multiple DE configuration strategies:

Initialization: uniform, xavier, normal

Mutation: rand1, rand2, best1, jde, gauss

Crossover: binomial, exponential

Selection: greedy, tournament

Diversity: none, sharing, crowding (only sharing is implemented)

Real-time comparison using a Tkinter GUI with:

Accuracy, loss, fitness, and diversity plots

Confusion matrices for DE and BP

Sample predictions for digits 0‚Äì9
